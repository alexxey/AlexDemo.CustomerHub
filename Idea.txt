I have nexr simple domain model:

enumerations: 
	StatusEnum : enumeration (created, active, disabled, deleted)
	CountryEnum : enumeration (UK, USA, Sweden, France)
	ProjectStatusEnum : enumeration (idea, design, ...)
	ProjectUserRole: enumeration (ProjectManager, QA, Developer, BusinessAnalyst ...)
	CompanyPosition : enumeration (CEO, CFO, Director, Accountant, Developer, Manager ... )

1) Application has list of companies (1Company entity)
	Company Entity Fields: 
		- Id : int
		- Name (unique) : string
		- Country : CountryEnum
		- Ceo : string
		- Website : url
		- EmployeesCount : int	
		- Status : StatusEnum
		
2) Each Company can have 1 or more Offices associated (CompanyOffice entity), 1 office is always marked as headOffice. It is not possible to have an office detached from a company
	CompanyOffice Entity Fields:
		- Id : int
		- OfficeName : string 
		- Code : string (unique per company)
		- IsHeadOffice : bool
		- Country: CountryEnum
		- ZipCode: string 		
		- Status : StatusEnumm
		- EmployesCount: int
		- CompanyID : int
		
3) Each Company also has 0 or more employees (User entity), each employee has main office associated with. It is not possible to have a user without Company/HeadOffice
	User Entity Fields:
		- Id : int
		- DateOfBirth : DateTime
		- Login : string
		- PasswordHash : string
		- PasswordSalt : string
		- Email
		- CompanyPosition : CompanyPosition
		- MainOfficeID : int 
		- CompanyID : int
		- Status : StatusEnum

4) Company can have a list (0 or more) of Project entities. Each project has 1 owner user and several associated users.
	Project Entity Fields: 
		- Id : UUID
		- CodeName : string (unique per Company), once created - immutable
		- Name : string
		- Description : string
		- StartDate : DateTime
		- ProjectBudget : decimal
		- EndDate : DateTime (might be null)
		- OfficeID : reference to the office that is responsible for the project 		
		- ProjectStatus: ProjectStatusEnum		
		- Status : StatusEnum					
		
5) ProjectUser entity : entity to store details when person joined the Project, that the occupation if the person and Tasks assigned
	ProjectUser Entity Fields:
		- ProjectID
		- UserID
		- StartDate: DateTime
		- EndDate : DateTime (might be null)
		- ProjectRole : ProjectUserRole
		- PositionDescription : string

functionality that I would like to implement in phase 1:
1) For individual user to be able to login into application - to see List of projects that user participates in (or used to participate) : an ability to search by CodeName, date range, status
2) an ability to create a new Project, define dates, details, budget, assign Project owner
3) an ability to edit current project details (change status, update description, StartDate, EndDate, change Project Owner)
2) User Can Delete project : change status to Deleted

Layers of Application: 
1) Core : stores all main domain entities (Classes), enumerations (Enum) amd dictionaries that are associated with core application
2) Core.Application 
- stores interfaces that describe main functionality related to domain model
- have some Transport/DTOs model to encapsulate main domain model (do not expose it fully)
3) Presentation.Api - WebApi application that returns application models to consumers (web applications and mobile devices)
4) Presenation.WebUI - MVC core application to provide UI/functionality for users to manage Projects

Questions:
1) using the clean architecture approach and SOLID/GRASP practices - where I should define and design DataAccess and BusinessLogic (Services) layer?
2) what transport/View models I should define for the first drop
3) what Endpoints to manage Project I need to define in WebApi and WebUI projects?
